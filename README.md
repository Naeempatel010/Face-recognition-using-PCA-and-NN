# Face-recognition-using-PCA-and-NN


two files "Mom and son containing images of me and mom"

two .py files 

one to train my model and other to run the webcam and detect my face
You just need to add two folders Whatever you want and add 1000 images of each
Beware you need Gray scale images of width 28x28

and also some preprocessing like cropping the face also.Sorry! I am still a beginner at this
